				<span class="title">The 1950s called and wanted their toolbox back</span>
				<span class="date">Jan 2015</span>
				<span class="content">Your favourite fancy-pants modern
					programming language is from the 1950s. Pretty much any programming
					language used today is a derivative of Fortran or Lisp, both born
					in the 1950s. Okay, reality check: It’s 2013—yes, 60 years
					later—and we have cars that drive themselves on the street, robots
					roaming the surface of alien planets and tiny networked devices
					with interactive surfaces that we keep in our pockets, which are
					orders of magnitude more powerful than the computers of the 1950s.</span>

				<span class="title">Hello, Dropbox</span>
				<span class="date">Jan 2015</span>
				<span class="content">I’m very excited to let you know that
					I’m joining Dropbox. After two years at Facebook I couldn’t be more
					proud. Proud to have been part of something as important as
					Facebook and proud of the work I’ve done with shaping the future of
					mobile communication. It’s truly been a fantastic time of my life.
					At Dropbox I’m going to work hard to make all our lives better.
					Remove friction from technical details in our modern daily lives,
					and relieve us from worrying about our ‘stuff’ — from quick
					snapshots and hasty notes to precious memories.</span>
