			exists to make it easy for programs to talk with one another over the

		class="content">Your favourite fancy-pants modern programming
			language is from the 1950s. Pretty much any programming language used
			today is a derivative of Fortran or Lisp, both born in the 1950s.
			Okay, reality check: It's 2013 — yes, 60 years later—and we have
			cars that drive themselves on the street, robots roaming the surface
			of alien planets and tiny networked devices with interactive surfaces
			that we keep in our pockets, which are orders of magnitude more
			powerful than the computers of the 1950s.</span>

		class="date">Jan 2015</span> <span class="content">I'm very
			excited to let you know that I'am joining Dropbox. After two years
			at Facebook I couldn't be more proud. Proud to have been part of
			something as important as Facebook and proud of the work I've done
			with shaping the future of mobile communication. It's truly been a
			fantastic time of my life. At Dropbox Iâm going to work hard to
			make all our lives better. Remove friction from technical details in
			our modern daily lives, and relieve us from worrying about our
			"stuff" — from quick snapshots and hasty notes to precious
			memories.</span>
